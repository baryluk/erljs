This code is currently licensed under GPL.

If you will contriubte to this project you permit me,
Witold Baryluk to switch to any other license
of all files including your contributions.
(Old codes, repositories and releases will
be available still under GPL). I'm
guaranting that authors names will be not be removed,
and will be advertised.
This is only about patches or any other enhancments you
send me. By sending them you approve above statments.
If you want to develop this program with accordance of
GPL and continue to do so without "fear" of lossing
your work, you can at any point "fork" this project
and develop it without me.

Files generated or produced by this project (like recompiled
js files, vm machine, handlers, etc) are not licensced under GPL,
similary like binaries produced by GCC isn't and can be used
for any purpose.

Exception is vm machine which is still licensced GPL,
without above notes. This is so even if vm machine code
is embeded in one file with another code or data.

Parts borrowed from the Erlang, like some modified modules (lists,...)
are licensed according to their license and are not part of this project.
The patches which implements missing functionality (which wasn't there,
even in comments), is part of this project.

No part of this project which implementes some Erlang
funcionality in the JavaScript or in compiler by rewriting
to special bytecode, JavaScript, recompilation or interpretation,
have been writen using more than just erlang documentation
(manual pages) and the observing behaiour of Erlang.
This include even obscure opcodes like trim, or hard functions
like erlang:phash/2, erlang:term_to_binary/1 and others.
All of them have been reversed enginered without looking
at any Erlang or C source files of Erlang/OTP project.


Hopefully when this project gets shape I will release it using
some more free licencse.
