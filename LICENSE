If you want to develop this program with accordance of
GPL and continue to do so without "fear" of lossing
your work, you can at any point "fork" this project
and develop it without me.

Files generated or produced by this project (like recompiled
js files, vm machine, handlers, etc) are not licensced under GPL,
similary like binaries produced by GCC isn't and can be used
for any purpose.

Exception is vm machine which is still licensced GPL,
without above notes. This is so even if vm machine code
is embeded in one file with another code or data.

Parts borrowed from the Erlang, like some modified modules (lists,...)
are licensed according to their license and are not part of this project.
The patches which implements missing functionality (which wasn't there,
even in comments), is part of this project.

Hopefully when this project gets shape I will release it using
some more free licencse.
